## ‚ùî Elaborating on the Engage Challenge Prompts
### How does my app demonstrate the use of algorithms in streaming apps?
- Under Spotify Stats
  -  Top Tracks & Artists: Algorithms employed by Spotify determine which songs we like the most
  -  By Popularity, Length and Release Date Cards: Searching algorithms employed to find the tracks on the ends of the spectrum
- Under Song Recommendations Section
  - Search bar: Employs the Spotify Search Engine Algorithm to produce results
  - Song Recommendations: Audio Analysis and NLP algorithms (and possibly Content-based Filtering algorithms too) to fetch recommendations

#### Demonstrate what kind of role would a sorting algorithm play in a Recommendation Engine
- Sorting algorithms are vital in sorting the ranking generated by recommendation engines. 
- They are utilized in both the search algorithm as well as the recommendation system in Spotify. 
- In Search Algorithms, the search results need to be ranked and re-ranked based on relevancy as a user types out their query. This is decided by several user behavior elements and the metadata of heterogenous content types (songs, podcasts, radios, etc.).

#### What is the most efficient sorting algorithm to use in this scenario, and why?
- A ranking algorithm that handles multiple parameters with with varying granularities will be the most efficient algorithm. 
- There are several ML and Deep Learning based algorithms that rank data such as Bayesian Ranking, Regressions, etc. The exact algorithm to be used differs based on the use case and kind of optimizations that are required.

#### Demonstrate what kind of role would a search algorithm play in a Recommendation Engine? Which search algorithm does your app use, and why?
- An ideal search algorithm must be capable of effectively utilizing the data available to narrow down the search space as much as possible. 
- Hence, a combination of Information Retrieval Methods and Machine Learning Algorithms work best, just like how it done in the industry. 
- Such algorithms allow us to enhance the precision/confidence levels of the probabilistic search results. Given the scope to harvest vast amounts of data in terms of user behaviour and the content's data, it becomes a choice to naturally utilize the same too. 
- This app uses Spotify's search algorithm via the Spotify API - but since the app accesses the engine via an API, the search algorithm is unable to access user-specific data to fine tune the results. This, although, doesn't have an effect on the results in the Statify app.

## :dart: Features

## :star: Why Statify? // Inspiration

### Music Discovery
I'm sure there's been at least one time where you were vibing to one of your favourite songs wondered if you'll ever be able to find a song as great as that one. Enter Statify. Statify's music discovery feature allows users to discover songs similar to the song they provide as input. What's more? Users can save the recommendations as a playlist as well!

The Music Discovery part of the app contains two parts: searching for a song to seed as input, and fetching recommendations. These will be used to illustrate the significance of searching and sorting algorithms, as required by the Problem Statement.

### Profile Visualizations
Everyone loves Spotify Wrapped. We love to look back at our music and reflect upon it. Spotify Wrapped is simply a fun and feel-good experience for the users to flaunt their streaming habits. But the downside? Wrapped comes out only once a year, leaving us wanting more. 

Statify caters to exactly that. Statify allows users to look at their Spotify profiles at a deeper level than Wrapped at any time they wish. It comes with more visualizations of their streaming habits which your usual Wrapped doesn't show you.

This part adds a fun element to Statify. It uses sorting algorithms to process the streaming data of the user to provide the statistics.

## :memo: Challenges Faced and Learnings
- Being new to Flutter, it felt daunting to comprehend how Flutter and its widget structure works. Working on this project helped me **accelerate my learning curve** by a mile.
- It was a great exercise to deal with an ambiguous problem statement and come up with ideas - gave a feel of what to expect in the industry.
- **Learnt a great deal about algorithms** - classification and recommendation algorithms in particular. Found myself down a reading spiral as I read up about the math and algorithms during my research about the project.
- Understood deeply with regards to **how user authentication and OAuth2.0 work.**
- Since support for Web platforms in Flutter is new, I couldn't automate the process of receiving the authorization code after user authentication. It took me a lot of time to figure out what as going wrong and why when I tried to automate it. I eventually found a workaround to complete the authentication manually.
- There were limitations with the Spotify API in handling users, which I'd discovered late into the project. It **taught me to investigate my choices** thoroughly.
- I picked up **Test-Driven Development** here. I hope to get better at it and incorporate more rigourous testing in my projects in the future.

> **Flutter Limitations**
>  Flutter does not have an implementation to listen to link streams on Web platforms yet. Thus, listening to callbacks and retrieving the response can't be automated, unlike websites built with JavaScript.
>  In order to overcome that limitation, the app uses 2 additional pages to manually retrieve the callback response and pass it to the app.
>  - The first page is the page at the `redirect_uri` registered with the Spotify API. It contains a link which the user is prompted to click. On clicking, it redirects to a page within the app along with the callback response as arguments.
>  - The second page retrieves the arguments from its URL and passes it on to the upcoming pages for usage. This page resides within the app itself.

## :construction: What's next for Statify?

 - [ ] Add sharing profile stats as images for external sharing (Half-implemented, just not supported on Web)
 - [ ] Make Website more responsive
 - [ ] Add more timeframes to filter for Top Tracks & Artists
